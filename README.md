An alternative script for running [sbt](https://github.com/sbt/sbt "sbt home").
It works with sbt 0.13.0 projects and (in principle) all earlier versions.
If you're in an sbt project directory, the system will figure out the
required versions of sbt and scala, downloading them if necessary.

## Installation

Put the (self-contained) [sbt script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulp/sbt-extras/master/sbt "sbt") somewhere on your path, for instance:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulp/sbt-extras/master/sbt > ~/bin/sbt \
  && chmod 0755 ~/bin/sbt
```

## Sample usage

sbt -v[erbosely] creating a new project built with the latest scala 2.10.x.

```
% sbt -v -210 -sbt-create about
[addSbt] arg = '++ 2.10.6'
[residual] arg = 'about'
No extra sbt options have been defined
Detected sbt version 0.13.12
Using default jvm options
Detected Java version: 1.8.0_72

about

[info] Setting version to 2.10.6
[info] This is sbt 0.13.12
[info] The current project is built against Scala 2.10.6
[info] sbt, sbt plugins, and build definitions are using Scala 2.10.6
```

## sbt -h
```
Usage: sbt [options]

Note that options which are passed along to sbt begin with -- whereas
options to this runner use a single dash. Any sbt command can be scheduled
to run first by prefixing the command with --, so --warn, --error and so on
are not special.

Output filtering: if there is a file in the home directory called .sbtignore
and this is not an interactive sbt session, the file is treated as a list of
bash regular expressions. Output lines which match any regex are not echoed.
One can see exactly which lines would have been suppressed by starting this
runner with the -x option.

  -h | -help         print this message
  -v                 verbose operation (this runner is chattier)
  -d, -w, -q         aliases for --debug, --warn, --error (q means quiet)
  -x                 debug this script
  -trace <level>     display stack traces with a max of <level> frames (default: -1, traces suppressed)
  -debug-inc         enable debugging log for the incremental compiler
  -no-colors         disable ANSI color codes
  -sbt-create        start sbt even if current directory contains no sbt project
  -sbt-dir   <path>  path to global settings/plugins directory (default: ~/.sbt/<version>)
  -sbt-boot  <path>  path to shared boot directory (default: ~/.sbt/boot in 0.11+)
  -ivy       <path>  path to local Ivy repository (default: ~/.ivy2)
  -no-share          use all local caches; no sharing
  -offline           put sbt in offline mode
  -jvm-debug <port>  Turn on JVM debugging, open at the given port.
  -batch             Disable interactive mode
  -prompt <expr>     Set the sbt prompt; in expr, 's' is the State and 'e' is Extracted
  -script <file>     Run the specified file as a scala script

  # sbt version (default: sbt.version from project/build.properties if present, otherwise 0.13.12)
  -sbt-force-latest         force the use of the latest release of sbt: 0.13.12
  -sbt-version  <version>   use the specified version of sbt (default: 0.13.12)
  -sbt-dev                  use the latest pre-release version of sbt: 0.13.12
  -sbt-jar      <path>      use the specified jar as the sbt launcher
  -sbt-launch-dir <path>    directory to hold sbt launchers (default: ~/.sbt/launchers)
  -sbt-launch-repo <url>    repo url for downloading sbt launcher jar (default: http://repo.typesafe.com/typesafe/ivy-releases)

  # scala version (default: as chosen by sbt)
  -28                       use 2.8.2
  -29                       use 2.9.3
  -210                      use 2.10.6
  -211                      use 2.11.8
  -212                      use 2.12.0-M5
  -scala-home <path>        use the scala build at the specified directory
  -scala-version <version>  use the specified version of scala
  -binary-version <version> use the specified scala version when searching for dependencies

  # java version (default: java from PATH, currently java version "1.8.0_72")
  -java-home <path>         alternate JAVA_HOME

  # passing options to the jvm - note it does NOT use JAVA_OPTS due to pollution
  # The default set is used if JVM_OPTS is unset and no -jvm-opts file is found
  <default>        -Xms512m -Xmx1536m -Xss2m -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=256m -XX:+TieredCompilation -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC
  JVM_OPTS         environment variable holding either the jvm args directly, or
                   the reference to a file containing jvm args if given path is prepended by '@' (e.g. '@/etc/jvmopts')
                   Note: "@"-file is overridden by local '.jvmopts' or '-jvm-opts' argument.
  -jvm-opts <path> file containing jvm args (if not given, .jvmopts in project root is used if present)
  -Dkey=val        pass -Dkey=val directly to the jvm
  -J-X             pass option -X directly to the jvm (-J is stripped)

  # passing options to sbt, OR to this runner
  SBT_OPTS         environment variable holding either the sbt args directly, or
                   the reference to a file containing sbt args if given path is prepended by '@' (e.g. '@/etc/sbtopts')
                   Note: "@"-file is overridden by local '.sbtopts' or '-sbt-opts' argument.
  -sbt-opts <path> file containing sbt args (if not given, .sbtopts in project root is used if present)
  -S-X             add -X to sbt's scalacOptions (-S is stripped)
```

## My ~/.sbtignore - fairly aggressive.
