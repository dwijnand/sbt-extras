sbt: the rebel cut
==================

An alternative script for running [sbt](https://github.com/harrah/xsbt).
It works with sbt 0.7x projects as well as 0.10+.  If you're in an sbt
project directory, the runner will figure out the versions of sbt
and scala required by the project and download them if necessary.

There's also a template project sbt coming together, but it's unfinished.
See below for how to pull the template project in as a plugin.
However the runner is quite useful already.

Here's a sample use of the runner: it creates a new project using a
snapshot version of sbt as well as a snapshot version of scala, then
runs the sbt "about" command.

    % sbt -d -sbt-snapshot -210 -sbt-create about

## SBT Extra plugin

To see the plugin in action, including the thrilling custom sbt command "help-names":

    cd template-project && ../sbt -sbt-rc help-names zomg zomg2
    
The template files are:

    project/plugins/project/Build.scala   # you can use this as-is if you want
    project/Build.scala                   # this is a starting point for your real Build.scala

The Template build isn't quite finished.  There will most likely be a build.sbt DSL variant that does not require a project scala file.

## Simple SBT DSL

SBT extras defines a simplified task DSL for those who are defining simple tasks that do not need to be relied upon, or you are unsure and can refactor later.   Once including the sbt-extra-plugin, all you have to do is place the following in your build.sbt to create tasks:

    simple_task("zomg") is { println("ZOMG") }

or if you need to depend on other keys:

    simple_task("zomg2") on (name, version) is { (n,v) => println("ZOMG " + n + " = " + v + " !!!!!") }

The DSL currently supports between 0 and 9 dependencies.  The DSL does not allow defining tasks on different configurations, although this will be added shortly.

### Simple Setttings

SBT distinguishes between defining Setting and Tasks through the `apply` and `map` methods.   The Simple DSL has no such distinction.   Defining a setting is as easy as:

    simple_setting("name") is "project-name"

Settings can also depend on other settings.

    simple_setting("name") on (version) is { v => "project-name" + v }

Since a Setting can *only* be defined using other settings, attempting to use a non-setting in the on calls results in a type error.
